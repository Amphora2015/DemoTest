ISSUE #: ADCM-167
REQUEST BY: DEVENDER MARAGANI
DESCRIPTION: When we fax/email an associated doc, a row should be inserted into the vaulted_docs table.
             This is not happening at Mercuria.
             What is strange is that the build currently on CNF01 is doing this properly

SOLUTION: RECOMPILE THE STORED PROCEDURE AFFECTED WITH THE CORRECT CODE. 

OBJECTS AFFECTED:
PROCEDURE: P_INSERT_VAULT_REQUEST.
