ISSUE #: ADCM-193
REQUEST BY: JACK BURKE
DESCRIPTION: Peter, Javier
I need a function to calculate the number of workdays between two dates.
This can be simple, with Monday through Friday considered workdays, and Saturday and Sunday  are not workdays.
No need  to  consider Holidays.
This will be called very frequently, so  performance is key.


SOLUTION: NEW FUNCTION CREATED

OBJECTS CREATED: ConfirmMgr.UDF_WEEKDAYS_BETWEEN_2_DAYS

OBJECTS AFFECTED: N/A
